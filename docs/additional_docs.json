Segment audiences by intentâ€”awareness, consideration, and conversion. Retarget users who previously interacted with your brand for higher ROI. Always layer demographics with interests to refine targeting."

Pause underperforming ads and allocate more budget to high-performing ones. Keep frequency below 5 impressions per user per week to reduce ad fatigue. Use automated rules to increase bids when CTR is above 2%."

Review pacing daily to ensure the budget lasts the entire campaign duration. Avoid spreading budgets too thin across too many ad groups. Consider increasing budget gradually for scaling instead of large jumps."
